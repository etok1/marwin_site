# marwin_site

by Eva Tokmakova

This is a project of a simple website for Marwin vinyl e-shop. This project was made by a student of the Algoritmika Frontend development course (March - August 2023) for the Marwin hackathon during July 15th - August 5th 2023.

I used Javascript, HTML, CSS, Google maps, Google fonts (https://fonts.google.com/) and FontAwesome icons (https://fontawesome.ru/) for this project.

In the e-shop you can see vinyls of different singers. The main page contains the list of all available artists and for each artist you can view theirs vinyls by clicking 'view more' button, also you can see each vinyl's tracklist by clicking 'show tracklist' button. The website has the searching functionality on individual artist page so a user can find a desired record. You are able to add chosen products to the cart and leave a review. The user is also able to check the chosen vinyls in the cart, but there is no further functionality for the checkout process as well as the removing of the added to the cart vinyls.

As part of the further project development I would like to add filtering and sorting functionality for the vinyl records, backend intergration to achieve dynamic generation of the artists and records list.
